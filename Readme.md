# ASP.NET MVC Dashboard - How to obtain data for Web Dashboard from online spreadsheets


<p>This is a sample project that connects Dashboard to a Google Drive spreadsheet. Follow the steps below to create a data source based on the online spreadsheet:<br>1. Set MvcDashboard as a startup project and launch the application.<br>2. Click the 'Sign in GoogleDrive' button to sign into the Google Account and allow the current application to view files in your Google Drive. <br>3. After redirection click the 'Add New ExcelDataSource' button to select the required spreadsheet file and data (like sheets, tables, or named ranges). <br>The created data source is now available for your dashboards.<br><br>Note that this sample project is a prototype that shows the possibility of using a third-party API to extend the Web Dashboard functionality. We do not plan to make access to Google Drive a built-in feature in Web Dashboard in the near future, but you can use the provided project as a starting point to implement this functionality in your project. <br><br><strong>See also</strong><br><a href="https://community.devexpress.com/blogs/news/archive/2017/09/20/connect-dashboard-google-drive-spreadsheet.aspx">DevExpress Blogs - Connect Dashboard to a Google Drive Spreadsheet</a></p>
